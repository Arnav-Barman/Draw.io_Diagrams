# Learning Python
As the name suggests, this repo contains all the python notebooks that I used to get started with python. I did the following courses to understand python better:
- [Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai)
- [Python Project for AI & Application Development by IBM](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-ai-application-development)
> I am currently pursuing these courses and will keep updating the repo as I learn more.
